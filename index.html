            <p>I'm currently a studdent at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">thinkful</a>, living in Riverside California.</p>
            <p>I'd ultimately love to build websites that:</p>
            <!-- unordered list, followed by list items -->
            <ul>
              <li>have satisfying and clean code</li>
              <li>are informational and educational</li>
              <li>help promote or facilitate charitable work</li>
              <li>have some cute animals</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've always been interested in and comfortable with computers and technology, and am excited to move towards working with them as a career.  I also look forward to working with others as a team to complete large scale projects beyond an individual's scope.</p>              
            <p>I can remember writing rudimentary programs on a ti-84 calculator during art history class back in high school.  Good times.</p>
            <p>I realized fairly late in life, at 27, that I'm trans.  It's the best thing that's happened in my life, and gave me a new motivation for personal and professional growth.</p>
            <p>I've loved animals all my life, and after many years having many pet rats, I now have two wonderful cats.</p>
